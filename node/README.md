# Glitch Hosted Sample Trello Power-Up 🚀

Hey there 👋

This is a bare-bones template for building a new Trello Power-Up. What does that mean for you? We hope it's a great starting point for you to remix, and make your own great Power-Up that makes Trello work even better for you. 

Once you remix this, you'll want to take a look at what the new name is. Click the `Show Live` button up in the top bar and grab that url and then head here:

👉  [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)

Select the Trello team you want to add the Power-Up to. Note: You need to be an admin of the Trello team to add custom Power-Ups to it.

Now click the `Create new Power-Up` button. If this is your first time creating a Power-Up, you'll need to agree to a "Joint Developer Agreement" first. After you have done that, you just need to give your cool new Power-Up a name, and paste the url link into the field titled `Iframe connector URL` (the one you copied earlier).

This Power-Up doesn't make use of any capabilities out of the box, so you'll want to turn on the capabilities you want to use. You'll also need a URL for an icon. You can use the sample one we have here: [https://cdn.glitch.com/2442c68d-7b6d-4b69-9d13-feab530aa88e%2Fglitch-icon.svg?1489773457908](https://cdn.glitch.com/2442c68d-7b6d-4b69-9d13-feab530aa88e%2Fglitch-icon.svg?1489773457908).

Click `Save` and it's time to celebrate 🎉 🎊

Now when you look at the Power-Ups for any board in that team, your awesome new Power-Up will be available. You can continue to make changes to the Glitch project and you'll see that reflected in Trello (you may just need to refresh).
